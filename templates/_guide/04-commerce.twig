Craft Commerce is our first-party plugin that extends Craft CMS for custom ecommerce.

So far we’ve strictly looked at features of Craft CMS, but Craft Commerce adds a wealth of features that should feel right at home in Craft CMS.

If you haven’t already, have a look at [Commerce]({{ cpUrl('commerce') }}) in the primary control panel navigation:

Where Craft CMS empowers content authors, Craft Commerce is for store managers. Your own project can separate or blend those roles however you’d like.

## Commerce Elements

On the [Content]({{ cpUrl('guide/page/content') }}) page we looked at Craft’s common elements, each tailored for a specific purpose and allowing any number of custom fields for your content. Craft Commerce adds its own elements to Craft, including Products and Orders.

### Products

Navigate to **Commerce** → **Products** to see a list of the site’s bikes.

In a larger store, you might choose to add more Product Types in the same way you could have any number of Craft Entry Types.

Products are the things for sale, each with common fields related to shipping, promotions, and tax as well as the custom fields you add to the layout.

An important aspect of products are its [Variants](https://craftcms.com/docs/commerce/3.x/products-variants.html)—from a product detail page click the **Variants** tab. There may be one or several variants, and there will always be a single default.

The site is configured with subscription plans you’ll see in **Commerce** → **Subscriptions**, and could also take advantage of donations that could be configured at **Commerce** → **Store Settings** → **Donations**.

### Orders

Your demo was created with a bunch of fake [orders]({{ cpUrl('commerce/orders') }}) so you can see what they look like in the control panel.

Each [order](https://craftcms.com/docs/commerce/3.x/orders-carts.html) is an element, built by a customer on the front end or by a store manager in the control panel. An order starts its life as a cart until it’s completed via checkout or manual action by a store manager. Every order is visible from the control panel, and can be configured with custom statuses, bespoke email and PDF invoice templates, and paid for—partially or in full—with [one of several available payment gateways](https://craftcms.com/docs/commerce/3.x/payment-gateways.html#first-party-gateway-plugins).

## Custom Field Types

Commerce includes field types you can use in any custom layout to easily relate your store’s products and variants to any other Craft content.

### Products Field

One example is the _Products_ field you’ll see in an article’s content blocks. You can use it to choose up to three products to promote within the content of a post:

## Store Management

It would be excessive to cover every configurable Commerce option here. Consider exploring the Commerce submenus and settings and we’ll hit on some of the big ones.

### Email and Invoices

You can fully customize your store’s email notifications and PDF invoices, including when they’re triggered and exactly how they look. Visit **Commerce** → **System Settings** and check out the **Emails** and **PDFs** sections.

### Payment Currencies

In **Commerce** → **Store Settings** → **Payment Currencies**, you can define any currencies you’d like to be available for payment at checkout.

### Promotions

In **Commerce** → **Promotions**, you can manage site-wide sales and cart-specific discounts. There’s an existing 10% off sale on red bikes and a coupon code for 15% off any item that doesn’t apply to any on sale. Try creating a sale or discount to get a look at how flexible they can be.

### Shipping

You can configure shipping schemes and options in **Commerce** → **Shipping**. Any number of shipping methods can be established, whose availability for an order depend on a combination of subjective categories and geographic zones.

### Tax

Similar to shipping, you can establish any number of tax rates for your store in **Commerce** → **Tax**. A combination of categories and zones can determine what rates apply to an order.

### Subscription Plans

Check out **Commerce** → **Subscriptions** to browse pretend customers’ subscription plans in their various states, and **Commerce** → **Store Settings** → **Plans** to see or change the plans that are available.

### Payment Gateways

Your demo uses Commerce’s included “Dummy” gateway, as you can see in **Commerce** → **System Settings** → **Gateways**. This allows everything to work normally for testing without making charges or sending any payment details to a third party. You can configure any number of [the available payment gateways](https://craftcms.com/docs/commerce/3.x/payment-gateways.html#first-party-gateway-plugins), or even [write your own](https://craftcms.com/docs/commerce/3.x/extend/payment-gateway-types.html)!
