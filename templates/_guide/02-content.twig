Let’s take a look at the main places you can organize content in Craft CMS. (Much of what’s here is detailed in our starter tutorial’s [Content in Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/configure/modeling.html) page.)

## Common Elements

This site doesn’t have a lot of content, but it’s built with the main types you might utilize in your own project.  
It’s where most editors would spend their time in the control panel managing content.

### Entries

The [Entries]({{ cpUrl('entries') }}) section is where most content is likely to live. Click **Entries** in the main navigation, and the **All entries** submenu will list everything in this area.

The submenu is further broken down into Craft’s major sections we call “Section Types.”

#### Channels

Channels are what you’ve probably seen in any CMS: dated posts that follow a common format. Spoke & Chain has an “Articles” channel with timely fake announcements, “Emails” and “PDFs” channels for managing customer notification and invoice content, an “Error Pages” channel for custom error page messaging, a “Reviews” channel with demo entries that could have been imported or synced from an outside system for a live site, and a “Plans” channel for managing subscription plan content.
