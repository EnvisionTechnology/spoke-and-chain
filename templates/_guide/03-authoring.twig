Now let’s take a look at editing content in Craft CMS.

Click **Entries** → **Articles** and click any title in the list to have a look at the entry editor.

## Common Fields

![](/guide/common-fields.png)

Most entries have the same basic required fields you’ll see in any CMS:

- **Title** is the primary, human-friendly name for the entry. (The field itself can have a different label that makes sense for the content, like “Service Name” or “Practice Area”.)
- **Slug** is the unique URL segment for the entry, automatically suggested as you enter a title.
- **Author** is the user responsible for the entry, which defaults to the one who created it.
- **Entry Date** and **Expiry Date** determine when the entry should be live on the site, and optionally disappear again. (You can future-date entries to have them appear later.)
- **Enabled** is a kill switch you can use to drop an entry from the site or prevent it from being published regardless of its other settings.
